The Marrow&#39;s largest predator, and the most feared for its ferocious temperament. Though surely fierce, the skull it bears looks taken from an even larger beast. If not for the bones as proof, I would scarcely believe bugs could grow to such scale.</li></ul></li><li>Kilik: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1d/B_Kilik.png" alt="Killik"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Small bony bug that favours dark tunnels.

Instinct keeps them at their task, though in much simpler fashion than before. This kingdom appears more advanced in metalwork than my own ever was, in great part due to the natural heat source at its base. Working in such an environment is an impressive feat.</li></ul></li><li>Flintstone Flyer: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/9/92/B_Flintstone_Flyer.png" alt="GRAND DAD"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Aerial worker lost to Pharloom&#39;s Haunting.

Civilisation encroaches from this kingdom&#39;s crown, but the lowlands are still ruled by great beasts. Its roar stirs something deep within me, some primal instinct.</li></ul></li><li>Caranid: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/8/82/B_Caranid.png" alt="thisthingy"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Common winged bug of the lowlands. Generally docile, but will attack if threats come close. Their plump, round shape makes them well-suited for target practice.

When angered, it rapidly whips its bladed tail as a weapon. Its wings are quite small compared to its bulk. Perhaps it uses the warm air of these fiery lands to help stay airborne. Clever, if so.</li></ul></li><li>Hardbone Hopper: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2e/B_Hardbone_Hopper.png" alt="technically its deepdocks but it also fits here better soooooo"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Grazing creature with sharp senses that nimbly retreats from danger. Despite the Haunting of its shell, it has not been overcome with aggression. Its desire to flee remains too strong.</li></ul></li><li>Hardbone Elder: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2c/B_Hardbone_Elder.png" alt="here ig"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Tall creature with sharp senses.

Roasts its prey by spitting scorching tar. Its sticky spit would no doubt make a useful crafting material if moulded fresh. Unfortunately, I cannot stop to experiment.</li></ul></li><li>Mawling: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/7/70/B_Mawling.png" alt="shush i know"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Young, bony bug that can curl its body to form a ball. Their rough, ridged shell grips tight to any surface. Even walls and roofs become pathways for these nimble bugs.</li></ul></li><li>Marrowmaw: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/4/4a/B_Marrowmaw.png" alt="so these are actually found inthe moss , nmed after the marrow, and i put it in far fielsd"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Giant roller of the lowlands. Its ridged hide will crush smaller creatures beneath it. Sheer bulk makes for an effective weapon, but requires much sustenance. This creature would have spent most of its time eating. An acceptable life for some.</li></ul></li><li>Hoker: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/0d/B_Hoker.png" alt="hoker"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Spine-shooting drifter of the lowlands. Whatever admiration I had for its fleecy down is spoilt by its disturbing mask... and its steely spines.</li></ul></li><li>Flintbeetle: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1a/B_Flintbeetle.png" alt="fleetle"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Rarely seen beetle that spends most of its life nestled deep in bone and rock. The flintgems on its shell excrete an explosive powder. Its bright gems could be used to make beautiful, but short-lived jewellery. An amusing idea for a gift... or a trap.</li></ul></li><li>Rhinogrund: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/07/B_Rhinogrund.png" alt="did you meet this?"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Long-Horned beast of Pharloom&#39;s lowlands. Relies on its horn to both impale and to wrench the ground beneath it, flinging dangerous debris. Certain tools and skills can pierce its defences. I should adjust my strategy as needed.</li></ul></li><li>Brushflit: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/51/B_Brushflit.png" alt="dowpeoeodkiedjcfiruhnviru"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Tiny, timid creatures that huddle in flocks and flee at the first hint of danger. They call out to their fellows at the smallest sense of threat. A successful hunt here means staying silent and hidden right up until the decisive strike.</li></ul></li><li>Fertid: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/7/74/B_Fertid.png" alt="eodierjfvoruit"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Skittish scrambler of the Far Fields. Its antennae resemble stalks of grass to aid in camouflage. It has no means to defend itself. Its only hope for survival is to be mistaken for a plant.</li></ul></li><li>Flapping Fertid: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/a7/B_Flapping_Fertid.png" alt="keerceceecfcf"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Docile bugs whose wings mimic the grasses of the Far Fields. A common snack for larger predators. When roosting, it would look convincingly plant-like. In flight, its bulbous body quickly ruins the ruse.</li></ul></li><li>Fourth Chorus: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/d/db/B_Fourth_Chorus.png/600px-B_Fourth_Chorus.png" alt="ecowdeweccwe"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Towering iron automaton, driven by rotor and cog.

Poor of sight but possessing a keen sense of smell, it uses its bulk to charge at foreign scents. Remaining fierce so far into old age is an admirable trait.</li></ul></li><li>Dreg Catcher: <img src="https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/bb/B_Dreg_Catcher.png" alt="edfrtrttrrt"><ul><li>Hornet&#39;s notes: Bug charged to catch dregs of Silk that fall from the Citadel.
