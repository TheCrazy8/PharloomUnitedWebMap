::: details Mosslands
- A mossy place, good for starting grand adventures.
- Leader: TBD
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Mossgrub:
![Mossgrub](./public/B_Mossgrub.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Fur covered crawler with a series of sharp spikes along its back. If not for the spikes, I would think it an appealing bug.
  - Massive Mossgrub:
![Massive Mossgrub](./public/B_Massive_Mossgrub.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Unnaturally overgrown Mossgrub, bred within the Citadel's Memorium. So close to a perfect furred form... If only they'd been able to breed out the spines.
  - Mossmir:
![Mossmir](./public/Mossmir_Idle.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small fluttering creature capable of defending itself with its small stinger. This bug is soft and clumsy, but to its fortune its home caves seem relatively free of effective predators. I wonder why that is.
  - Moss Mother:
![Moss Mother](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1e/B_Moss_Mother.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Adult Mossmir with fully developed stinger and hardened hide. Motherhood is an instinct that can push creatures beyond what seems their normal limits. It turns even weaker beasts like these into formidable foes.
  - Aknid:
![Aknid](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/fb/B_Aknid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Winged insect that feeds upon moss and lichen in the caves above Bone Bottom. In its natural state it would avoid potential predators, but Pharloom's Haunting now compels it to aggression. Fortunately, its jaws are ill-suited for combat.

  - Skull Scuttler:
![Skull Scuttler](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/03/B_Skull_Scuttler.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small, soft bug that uses the hard skulls of the Marrow for protection and disguise. In every land, creatures find new and surprising ways to disguise themselves. One must be wary always.
  - Skullwing:
![Skullwing](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/55/B_Skullwing.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Airborne relative of the grounded Skull Scuttler, found only in the Marrow's deepest, hottest caves. Such feeble creatures could only survive thanks to the rarity of predators in these super-heated caverns.
  - Skull Brute:
![Skull Brute](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/9/9a/B_Skull_Brute.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Soft bug beneath a huge, horned skull. Charges at intruders to protect its territory and its smaller companions. Either its size has made it fearless or the Haunting has removed its sense of self-preservation.
  - Skull Tyrant:
![Skulltyrant](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/29/B_Skull_Tyrant.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Rare, enormous Skull Scuttler. The Marrow's largest predator, and the most feared for its ferocious temperament. Though surely fierce, the skull it bears looks taken from an even larger beast. If not for the bones as proof, I would scarcely believe bugs could grow to such scale.
  - Kilik:
![Killik](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1d/B_Kilik.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small bony bug that favours dark tunnels. Can expand its spiked carapace to ward against attacking predators. I am fond of simple, effective traps such as this bug's extendable spikes. An unwary predator would be skewered clean through.
  - Beastfly:
![Beastfly](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/ba/B_Beastfly.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Aggressive fly of Pharloom's lowlands. Rams prey with its hardbone mask. Dancing around this simple creature as it charges back and forth is the sort of game I delighted in as a child. Alas, I now have more pressing matters to attend to.

::: details Deep Docks
- A firey industrial district with forges and the likes.
- Leader: TBD
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Lavalug:
![slug](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/c/c5/B_Lavalug.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Sticky mollusc that defends itself by spraying burning fluid from growths on its back. What seems at first a purely defensive mechanism may also be necessary to rid this creature of excess heat.
  - Lavalarga:
![slug but fat](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/4/45/B_Lavalarga.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Fully grown mollusc able to unleash a gushing torrent of burning fluid from its back. To survive while storing so much searing fluid within... Before I would have believed it impossible, but Pharloom is home to many marvels.
  - Smelt Shoveller:
![o](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/06/B_Smelt_Shoveller.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Low level worker lost to Pharloom's haunting. Instinct keeps them at their task, though in much simpler fashion than before. This kingdom appears more advanced in metalwork than my own ever was, in great part due to the natural heat source at its base. Working in such an environment is an impressive feat.
  - Flintstone Flyer:
![GRAND DAD](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/9/92/B_Flintstone_Flyer.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Aerial worker lost to Pharloom's Haunting. Bears a pouch full with flintstone which they will fling at intruders. That incendiary material they carry is a natural wonder, with many potential applications. What a waste to carelessly throw it at me whenever I pass by.
  - Flintflame Flyer:
![FLEENTSTONES?!](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/b1/B_Flintflame_Flyer.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Brave worker carrying unstable flintflame and wearing a heavy bell to protect against potential ignition. Theirs would be a high risk life, followed by a short, searing end.
  - Smokerock Sifter:
![egg](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1d/B_Smokerock_Sifter.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Cymbal bearing worker of the Deep Docks. Pans the hauls of smokerock to find traces of more precious minerals. The Haunting has stolen some important part of these bugs, yet still they attempt their former task. Until, that is, they sense my presence...
  - Deep Diver:
![deev](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/e/ef/B_Deep_Diver.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Bell-clad bug responsible for mining the deeper, treacherous depths below their docks. Their heavier bells armour them well against my strikes, but against that oppressive heat... can they help at all?

::: details Hunters March
- The lands of the Skarr Tribe, home to many traps.
- Leader: Last Claw
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Skarrlid:
![https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/ad/B_Skarrlid.png](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/ad/B_Skarrlid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small burrowing ant, servant to the larger Skarr. These bugs work mainly as finders and foragers for the warriors of their tribe. Combat has not long been their nature.
  - Skarrwing:
![feeff](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/20/B_Skarrwing.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Darting predator that clings fast to roofs and outcrops, often summoned to aid its larger companions. They would make effective hunting companions, though even without the Haunting I suspect their loyalty would always remain to their clan.
  - Skarr Scout:
![ruhyeifbovuegt](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2b/B_Skarr_Scout.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Young ant hunter wielding sickles carved from teeth. Will often call for aid if danger comes close. Despite their youth, they are impressive opponents. It seems likely their tribe were trained for combat from birth.
  - Skarr Stalker:
![ecefvrfv](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/13/B_Skarr_Stalker.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Skilled ant hunter bearing blade and armour fashioned from bone. Fierce, strong and disciplined... yet these qualities do not protect them from the Haunting. Is such a fate inevitable in these lands?
  - Spear Skarr:
![  dedededed](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/6/6e/Spear_Skarr.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Winged ant hunter that strikes from the air with its bone lance. In my youth, I envied all bugs with wings. I even fancied I might grow a pair... I have since learned better. Accept the limitations of one's body... and augment with tools as needed.
  - Skarrgard:
![eicfefvirvri](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/4/44/B_Skarrgard.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Huge ant hunter tasked to protect the stores and passages of its tribe. Theirs is the perfect shell for their duty, a wall of a warrior and an adept fighter. If I hope to claim their treasures, I must bring my best.

:::
::: details Far Fields
- The outer reaches of the Skarr Tribe, unintentionally heated by Deep Docks.
- Leader: Last Claw
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Savage Beastfly:
![theworstboss /j](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/6/68/B_Savage_Beastfly.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Angered, adult Beastfly with a weighty body and a thickened hardshell mask. Civilisation encroaches from this kingdom's crown, but the lowlands are still ruled by great beasts. Its roar stirs something deep within me, some primal instinct.
  - Caranid:
![thisthingy](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/8/82/B_Caranid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Common winged bug of the lowlands. Generally docile, but will attack if threats come close. Their plump, round shape makes them well-suited for target practice. Difficult to resist testing my aim on them...
  - Vile Caranid:
![thisalttextwontbeusedright?](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2c/B_Vicious_Caranid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Aggressively winged bug of the lowlands. When angered, it rapidly whips its bladed tail as a weapon. Its wings are quite small compared to its bulk. Perhaps it uses the warm air of these fiery lands to help stay airborne. Clever, if so.
  - Hardbone Hopper:
![technically its deepdocks but it also fits here better soooooo](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2e/B_Hardbone_Hopper.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Grazing creature with sharp senses that nimbly retreats from danger. Despite the Haunting of its shell, it has not been overcome with aggression. Its desire to flee remains too strong.
  - Hardbone Elder:
![here ig](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2c/B_Hardbone_Elder.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Tall creature with sharp senses. Defends its herd with powerful legs and a sharp tipped mask. There is surprising strength hidden in their thin, elegant limbs. It would be a pleasure to ride upon it...
  - Tarmite:
![Termate](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/06/B_Tarmite.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Flying bone mite that lives near magma. Roasts its prey by spitting scorching tar. Its sticky spit would no doubt make a useful crafting material if moulded fresh. Unfortunately, I cannot stop to experiment.
  - Mawling:
![shush i know](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/7/70/B_Mawling.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Young, bony bug that can curl its body to form a ball. Their rough, ridged shell grips tight to any surface. Even walls and roofs become pathways for these nimble bugs.
  - Marrowmaw:
![so these are actually found inthe moss , nmed after the marrow, and i put it in far fielsd](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/4/4a/B_Marrowmaw.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Giant roller of the lowlands. Its ridged hide will crush smaller creatures beneath it. Sheer bulk makes for an effective weapon, but requires much sustenance. This creature would have spent most of its time eating. An acceptable life for some.
  - Hoker:
![hoker](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/0d/B_Hoker.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Spine-shooting drifter of the lowlands. Whatever admiration I had for its fleecy down is spoilt by its disturbing mask... and its steely spines.
  - Flintbeetle:
![fleetle](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1a/B_Flintbeetle.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Rarely seen beetle that spends most of its life nestled deep in bone and rock. The flintgems on its shell excrete an explosive powder. Its bright gems could be used to make beautiful, but short-lived jewellery. An amusing idea for a gift... or a trap.
  - Rhinogrund:
![did you meet this?](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/07/B_Rhinogrund.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Long-Horned beast of Pharloom's lowlands. Relies on its horn to both impale and to wrench the ground beneath it, flinging dangerous debris. Certain tools and skills can pierce its defences. I should adjust my strategy as needed.
  - Brushflit:
![dowpeoeodkiedjcfiruhnviru](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/51/B_Brushflit.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Tiny, timid creatures that huddle in flocks and flee at the first hint of danger. They call out to their fellows at the smallest sense of threat. A successful hunt here means staying silent and hidden right up until the decisive strike.
  - Fertid:
![eodierjfvoruit](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/7/74/B_Fertid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Skittish scrambler of the Far Fields. Its antennae resemble stalks of grass to aid in camouflage. It has no means to defend itself. Its only hope for survival is to be mistaken for a plant.
  - Flapping Fertid:
![keerceceecfcf](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/a7/B_Flapping_Fertid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Docile bugs whose wings mimic the grasses of the Far Fields. A common snack for larger predators. When roosting, it would look convincingly plant-like. In flight, its bulbous body quickly ruins the ruse.
  - Fourth Chorus:
![ecowdeweccwe](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/d/db/B_Fourth_Chorus.png/600px-B_Fourth_Chorus.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Towering iron automaton, driven by rotor and cog. A terrifying achievement of Pharloom, to build a construct so large and yet so nimble.

- The eastern side of Greymoor, ruled by the Court of the Craws.
- Leader: Crawfather
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Craw:
![deded](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/d/d6/B_Craw.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Screeching scavenger that roosts high in caverns and preys on passing pilgrims. By this swooping menace, a simple bug could be easily overcome. More dangerous still, they rarely attack alone.
  - Tallcraw:
![dewivhwiirfvirw](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/23/B_Tallcraw.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Rag-winged adult crawbug bearing a scavenged pin. Far more hostile than their younger companions but seemingly less likely to roam far from their nest.
  - Squatcraw:
![defebgrthytresdfbgfbfwetynre](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/e/e4/B_Squatcraw.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Stout adult crawbug bearing several short pins. A cowardly sort. They will try to remain at range to throw their sharp weapons. Best to rush them down and cut quick.
  - Craw Juror:
![wr](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/7/79/B_Craw_Juror.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Screeching scavenger dyed black in mourning at their land's collapse. Weak, afraid, and aware of the imminent end. I understand their desperation, but my death will not prevent the coming fall.
  - Tallcraw Juror:
![https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/e/ef/B_Tallcraw_Juror.png/300px-B_Tallcraw_Juror.png](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/e/ef/B_Tallcraw_Juror.png/300px-B_Tallcraw_Juror.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Elder crawbug serving in a sacred ceremony. Curiosity saw me answer their summons, but I shall not allow them to stall me long. I must work fast to fix my grand mistake.
  - Squatcraw Juror:
![e](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/14/B_Squatcraw_Juror.png)
    - Short elder crawbug eagerly serving in their court. They seek to slay their only chance at survival. Alas, any words would fall useless. I have only my blade to offer response.
  - Crawfather:
![eeeeeeeeeeeee](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/8/87/B_Crawfather.png/299px-B_Crawfather.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Lord and justice of Pharloom's craws. Delivers death to condemned bugs with his steel-plated beak. Did he recognise my part played in this land's void-strung state? If so, perhaps his judgement was not unfair. To these bugs I have brought much destruction.

::: details Western Greymoor
- The west side of Greymoor, from the entrance to Far Fields home to Bellhart.
- Leader: TBD
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Mite:
![erf](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/09/B_Mite.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Verminous pest, common throughout the dark corners of Greymoor. Individually they offer little challenge, but their numbers are surely vast, and most remain hidden.
  - Fluttermite:
![ergry](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/c/c5/B_Fluttermite.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Airborne pest, less common than its grounded siblings. Attacks with sharp fangs if agitated. Similar bugs would gnaw away at unguarded food supplies in my homeland. As a child, I would hunt them, eager to make use of myself and test my skills.
  - Mitemother:
![erfurutviruv](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/ae/B_Mitemother.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Aged female mite, grown larger and stronger than most of its kin. Poor of sight but possessing a keen sense of smell, it uses its bulk to charge at foreign scents. Remaining fierce so far into old age is an admirable trait.
  - Dreg Catcher:
![edfrtrttrrt](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/bb/B_Dreg_Catcher.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Bug charged to catch dregs of Silk that fall from the Citadel. Will attack with its staff if provoked. These bugs look to have spent every waking moment at their work. Grim, endless labour in service of the unseen Citadel above.
  - Silk Snipper:
![wedewdfer](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/ff/B_Silk_Snipper.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Scissor-wielding bug charged to cut and spool fallen dregs of Silk for return to the Citadel above. Is it the Haunting that drove them to cackling madness, or was their unending toil the cause even before that?
  - Thread Raker:
![ewfjvhigbueirg](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/e/e4/B_Thread_Raker.png/300px-B_Thread_Raker.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Tall bug charged to pile Silk dregs in preparation for respooling. Their sharp rake now doubles equally well as a stabbing weapon. Theirs seems a sad, grueling task, serving their lifetime for a Citadel unseen.
  - Moorwing:
![dfdeve](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/6/6e/B_Moorwing.png/300px-B_Moorwing.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Winged mite-beast, bred large to catch workers who once tried to flee their tasks. With its wranglers long dead, the Moorwing stalked the towers of Greymoor, feasting on passing pilgrims and tenders alike.

  - Pond Skipper:
![dd](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/5e/B_Pond_Skipper.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Hard-shelled insect common upon the surface of Shellwood Pond. Once a staple food for passing pilgrims.The way they skate along the water's surface is so elegant. Surely it is a skill that can be learned? When time permits, I should attempt the task.
  - Pondcatcher:
![ervrgth](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/58/B_Pondcatcher.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Old catcher over Shellwood Pond, bearing a longpin and stricken by the Haunting. Once a hunter purely for food, now they hunt unthinking and unending.
  - Shellwood Gnat:
![dccf](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/6/6a/B_Shellwood_Gnat.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Tiny, soft creature that armours itself using the hard, hollow growths of Shellwood. If the woody hide is shattered, the bug will still bravely, foolishly try to attack.
  - Wood Wasp:
![dffg](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/e/ed/B_Wood_Wasp.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Pointed, darting insect that builds a hardy hive from Shellwood's dried bark. Destroying the hives will limit their presence in the wood. Useful to me now, as I pass along the branches. Dangerous in time for the wood's order. Even a small disruption can tip a fragile balance.
  - Splinter:
![defrg](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/5/5f/B_Splinter.png/300px-B_Splinter.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Insect formed to imitate a branch, capable of remaining perfectly still for long periods, but unexpectedly swift when roused. Avoiding their ambush is a good test of my senses, and my ability to rapidly retaliate.
  - Splinterhorn:
![!](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/9/91/B_Splinterhorn.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Insect formed to imitate a branch, born with sharp, retractable horns atop its head. Its shell gives it the advantage of surprise, but also forces it into a slender, brittle shape that cannot withstand a heavy attack.
  - Splinterbark:
![dcefrvgt](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/d/dc/B_Splinterbark.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Winged insect with a flaky shell that perfectly mimics its environment. Its assault... like a young bug's toy turned deadly. Could I, in time, fashion a spinning tool to match?
  - Sister Splinter:
![eefrvgt](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/5/5c/B_Sister_Splinter.png/300px-B_Sister_Splinter.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Imposing old insect nesting in the heights of Shellwood. Her command of twig and branch ensured no pilgrim ever survived her territory. This one lived long and fed much. The wood will be much safer for their slaying.
  - Phacia:
![wcdefr g](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/c/ce/B_Phacia.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Drifting bug disguised as a flower. Disperses crackling clouds of pollen if threatened. Quite a beautiful creature. In my own kingdom's court, it would have been highly favoured as an ornamental pet.
  - Pollencia:
![dceeef](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/f6/B_Pollenica.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Floral foe that reacts instinctively to movement nearby. Spits pellets of crackling pollen that burst on impact. What exceptional senses it possesses. It detects me with ease, even when not a single sound is made.
  - Gahlia:
![wwdcefrv](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/1/19/B_Gahlia.png/300px-B_Gahlia.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Floral foe with a core shaped to mimic a mask. The core can be thrust forth to bludgeon unwary bugs. The false mask alone is frightening enough to scare away smaller pests.
  - Nyleth:

  - Cragglite:
![this](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/fc/B_Cragglite.png)

- Leader: Crust King Khan
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Coral Furm:
![dcef](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/ac/B_Coral_Furm.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Dark-furred bug protecting itself with a spiked coral nut. Its fur is thick and silky. Sadly, lost to its Haunting, I shall never safely be able to touch it.
  - Driznit:
![ed3regt](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/e/e4/B_Driznit.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Nesting creature that fuses its face with sharpened coral. It is easy to be caught off-guard by the ricocheting trajectory of its flung mask, especially in tight corners.
  - Driznarga:
![defrgtbhyhbtgvrfcedx](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2c/B_Driznarga.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Large male Driznit, ferocious and territorial. Fires its heavy coral mask at intruders. A fine shot with its sharp mask. Its aggression has no ill effect on its aim.
  - Pokenabbin:
![wcervtbyn](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/fe/B_Pokenabbin.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Drifting creature with a wide coral mask and hard proboscis to stab its prey. Passively waits for prey to blunder into its path. A technique that should not necessarily be derided. Whatever is effective is best.
  - Conchfly:
![ecr](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/f2/B_Conchfly.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small bug that crafts a shell of sharpened coral. Spins its shell at rapid speed to cut through crust and bone. The way it darts in and out of the ground has an almost playful quality to it. An amusing and effective way to ambush prey.
  - Great Conchfly:
![ervtb](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/2/28/B_Great_Conchfly.png/300px-B_Great_Conchfly.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Elder Conchfly crowned with a huge coral horn. Once partnered with a mate, they will rarely be seen alone. To pair with another is a base instinct, and one that brings some bugs great joy. I once sought similar union, but of my own mates none could match my lifespan.
  - Crustcrawler:
![dwcefvrgb](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/4/4c/B_Crustcrawler.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Soft-shelled scrambler encased in coral. Hidden amongst their tower's matching crust, these smaller bugs would have survived and thrived.
  - Crustcrag:
![derfvtgbynuju](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/b2/B_Crustcrag.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Coral hulk with a dense shell, bred to immense size by the Citadel's Memorium. Nature distorted... This bug was born tiny and mild. The Citadel deformed it in futile hope it may sustain.
  - Kai:
![wervtr](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/8/8e/B_Kai.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Plump, plentiful drifter of a coral past. They once teemed around their tower, in numbers immense. It is a rare chance to witness such a bountiful display of life.
  - Spinebeak Kai:
![wdert](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/51/B_Spinebeak_Kai.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Steel horned floater, able to defend itself and its companions. A critical member of the larger flock. Without them present the Kai would be fast driven to extinction by larger predators.
  - Steelspine Kai:
![cevrgt](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/53/B_Steelspine_Kai.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Toughened Kai capable of extending sharp spikes from within its shellsack. Seeming soft, but hiding a sharp surprise. Any larger predator attempting a bite would learn a pointed and painful lesson.
  - Yuma:
![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/6/6b/B_Yuma.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Gelatinous coral drifter of simple mind and placid demeanour. A creature at its most basic. This one is no threat to me, or any other.
  - Yumama:
![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/0/03/B_Yumama.png/300px-B_Yumama.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Large, gelatinous drifter. Chases away threats by hurling its bulk around. When defeated, it splits into many smaller forms. Yet another remarkable creature of this land before the monarch.
  - Karaka:
![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/8/85/B_Karaka.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Staunch and skilled bladebug of a once flourishing land lost to time. The core member of a powerful order, trained fearless and faithful. Theirs was a kingdom of warriors, one built upon their blades.
  - Kakri:
![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/ff/B_Kakri.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Lithe, winged scouts frequently paired with their heavier brethren. Its training resembles my own, favouring fast strikes and rapid movement. Once a hunter, perhaps?
  - Yago:
![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/7/7d/B_Yago.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Wide-masked aerial attacker trained to act as support for its grounded companions while remaining at range. Not a frontline force, but in my assault upon their tower all emerge to see me stilled.
  - Karak Gor:
![defr](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/c/ca/B_Karak_Gor.png/300px-B_Karak_Gor.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Heavy, hard-shelled charger relying on weight and strength. Far tougher for being matched inside their encrusted domain. They must have lived their whole lives within their tower, to command it so.
  - Alita:
![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/6/68/B_Alita.png/300px-B_Alita.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Leaping hunter of a bygone age. The swiftest of their sect, deftly skilled with spinning foreblades. In contests of speed against strength, I have seen the swift more often triumphant, a lesson I have taken to my own heart.
  - Corrcrust Karaka:
![wwde](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/b7/B_Corrcrust_Karaka.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Overgrown elder, able to spawn burning bubbles from within its coral-cased shell. This bug's fusion with the crust-growth... It seems intentional, though I imagine the union is far from comfortable.
  - Crust King Khann:
![wffc](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/5/5d/B_Crust_King_Khann.png/300px-B_Crust_King_Khann.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Hardened warrior lord of a bygone age, able to command the coral crust to his bidding. For his stern stewardship his legions seemed utterly loyal. For less combative bugs his would have been a hard rule.
  - Watcher at the Edge:
![ert](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/6/61/B_Watcher_at_the_Edge.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Old warrior guarding the border of their domain, stiffened by time and awoken by song. They held long at their vigil, far beyond the age of their brethren, yet still when roused they swung their blade with remarkable ease.

![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/f9/B_Drapefly.png)

  - Drapemite:
![e](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/a5/B_Drapemite.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Cloth-covered crawler with sharpened forelimbs. Lives and breeds in dark places. Pharloom's structures seem almost built for them. The endless corners and cracks, so perfect for mites to burrow and nest.
  - Giant Drapemite:
![wcdefvrg](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/d/da/B_Giant_Drapemite.png/300px-B_Giant_Drapemite.png)

  - Clawmaiden:
![defr](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/ad/B_Clawmaiden.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Puppet servant of the Citadel, suspended on strings of Silk. An early form of automaton, requiring extensive Silk to maintain its service. If given a chance, this one will steal Silk from any significant source, including my own shell.

- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Cogwork Underfly:
![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/16/B_Cogwork_Underfly.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small automaton built to work, without complaint, in the scorching heat of the Underworks' Cauldron. It is no wonder these constructs were cast. No mortal bug would last long inside that scorching place. Even my shell struggles to withstand its heat.
  - Cogwork Hauler:
![r](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/f3/B_Cogwork_Hauler.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small automaton with a shielded shell, intended to carry loads of dangerous flintflame. Born and built only to work until time stiffens its limbs. Perhaps it is mercy this construct knows nothing of the freedom it lacks.
  - Cogwork Crawler:
![er](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/13/B_Cogwork_Crawler.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Automaton built in the shape of a scuttling bug. Its back contains retractable pins, intended to cut song cylinders free of any obstruction. Its form is certainly based on bugs found outside the Citadel. In my own craftwork, I too often look to nature for inspiration.
  - Cogworker:
![d](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/3/36/B_Cogworker.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Flighted automaton, responsible for repairing and extending the Core. More effective an opponent than would be guessed. The precarity of its winding domain can make even its simple assault a challenge.
  - Cogwork Spine:
![edcr](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/12/B_Cogwork_Spine.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Spherical, winged automaton housing many sharp spikes. I cannot decipher its function to the greater Core. Is it built for defence? If so, its passivity seems far from optimal.
  - Cogwork Choirbug:
![de](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/8/88/B_Cogwork_Choirbug.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Bug forged of iron, rotor and cog. The automaton works tirelessly to maintain the Core that houses it. Its core is filled with fine mechanisms, but that alone should not produce such a convincing mimic of life. Silk must also be used to animate this artifice, though exactly how I am not sure.
  - Cogwork Cleanser:
![](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/d/d3/B_Cogwork_Cleanser.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Steam shooting automaton, forged to clean the Cogwork Core and keep it free of infestation. An inspired use of steam. I must remember its construction when designing future tools.

  - Maestro:
![e](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/d/d0/B_Maestro.png/300px-B_Maestro.png)

  - Puny Penitent:

![freshfly prince of bel air](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1a/B_Freshfly.png)

  - Roachcatcher:

  - Roachfeeder:

    - Hornet's notes: Gentle glider of Mount Fay. Its downy wings and cowl allow it to resist even the most cutting cold. This one would make a perfect pet, but for the freezing temperatures it requires for comfort.
  - Mnemonid:

    - Hornet's notes: Flighted creature formed from coldshard. If shattered it will quickly reform. The coldshard, even when destroyed it remembers its former shape. A remarkable material, and perhaps even more astonishing there seems life contained within it.

    - Hornet's notes: Short-lived sprite born of flickering flame. To live only a single, bright moment... What would one feel? Is it glorious, or only despair? Or could it be both, mixed equal?
  - Burning Bug:
![qww](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/4/4e/B_Burning_Bug.png/300px-B_Burning_Bug.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Many-legged insect fanatically obsessed with flame. These ones somehow learnt to call and guide the scorching Wisps that share their thicket. Whether through dominance or reverence is unclear.
  - Father of the Flame:

    - Hornet's notes: Totem and god, built and worshipped by the Burning Bugs. The remains of an aged bug were housed at the pyre's heart. The structure suggested they wished for immolation. If so, I have seen their wish granted.
