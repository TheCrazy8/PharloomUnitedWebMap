## Info:
::: details Mosslands
- A mossy place, good for starting grand adventures.
- Leader: TBD
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Mossgrub:
![Mossgrub](./public/B_Mossgrub.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Fur covered crawler with a series of sharp spikes along its back. If not for the spikes, I would think it an appealing bug.
  - Massive Mossgrub:
![Massive Mossgrub](./public/B_Massive_Mossgrub.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Unnaturally overgrown Mossgrub, bred within the Citadel's Memorium. So close to a perfect furred form... If only they'd been able to breed out the spines.
  - Mossmir:
![Mossmir](./public/Mossmir_Idle.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small fluttering creature capable of defending itself with its small stinger. This bug is soft and clumsy, but to its fortune its home caves seem relatively free of effective predators. I wonder why that is.
  - Moss Mother:
![Moss Mother](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1e/B_Moss_Mother.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Adult Mossmir with fully developed stinger and hardened hide. Motherhood is an instinct that can push creatures beyond what seems their normal limits. It turns even weaker beasts like these into formidable foes.
  - Aknid:
![Aknid](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/fb/B_Aknid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Winged insect that feeds upon moss and lichen in the caves above Bone Bottom. In its natural state it would avoid potential predators, but Pharloom's Haunting now compels it to aggression. Fortunately, its jaws are ill-suited for combat.

::: details Bone Bottom
  - A town in the mosslands, a quite pleasant one at that.
  - Leader: Flick the fixer

::: details The Marrow
- A bony place, with fire and such.
- Leader: BigShip6556
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Skull Scuttler:
![Skull Scuttler](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/03/B_Skull_Scuttler.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small, soft bug that uses the hard skulls of the Marrow for protection and disguise. In every land, creatures find new and surprising ways to disguise themselves. One must be wary always.
  - Skullwing:
![Skullwing](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/55/B_Skullwing.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Airborne relative of the grounded Skull Scuttler, found only in the Marrow's deepest, hottest caves. Such feeble creatures could only survive thanks to the rarity of predators in these super-heated caverns.
  - Skull Brute:
![Skull Brute](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/9/9a/B_Skull_Brute.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Soft bug beneath a huge, horned skull. Charges at intruders to protect its territory and its smaller companions. Either its size has made it fearless or the Haunting has removed its sense of self-preservation.
  - Skull Tyrant:
![Skulltyrant](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/29/B_Skull_Tyrant.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Rare, enormous Skull Scuttler. The Marrow's largest predator, and the most feared for its ferocious temperament. Though surely fierce, the skull it bears looks taken from an even larger beast. If not for the bones as proof, I would scarcely believe bugs could grow to such scale.
  - Kilik:
![Killik](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1d/B_Kilik.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small bony bug that favours dark tunnels. Can expand its spiked carapace to ward against attacking predators. I am fond of simple, effective traps such as this bug's extendable spikes. An unwary predator would be skewered clean through.
  - Beastfly:
![Beastfly](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/ba/B_Beastfly.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Aggressive fly of Pharloom's lowlands. Rams prey with its hardbone mask. Dancing around this simple creature as it charges back and forth is the sort of game I delighted in as a child. Alas, I now have more pressing matters to attend to.

:::
::: details Deep Docks
- A firey industrial district with forges and the likes.
- Leader: TBD
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Lavalug:
![slug](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/c/c5/B_Lavalug.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Sticky mollusc that defends itself by spraying burning fluid from growths on its back. What seems at first a purely defensive mechanism may also be necessary to rid this creature of excess heat.
  - Lavalarga:
![slug but fat](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/4/45/B_Lavalarga.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Fully grown mollusc able to unleash a gushing torrent of burning fluid from its back. To survive while storing so much searing fluid within... Before I would have believed it impossible, but Pharloom is home to many marvels.
  - Smelt Shoveller:
![o](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/06/B_Smelt_Shoveller.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Low level worker lost to Pharloom's haunting. Instinct keeps them at their task, though in much simpler fashion than before. This kingdom appears more advanced in metalwork than my own ever was, in great part due to the natural heat source at its base. Working in such an environment is an impressive feat.
  - Flintstone Flyer:
![GRAND DAD](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/9/92/B_Flintstone_Flyer.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Aerial worker lost to Pharloom's Haunting. Bears a pouch full with flintstone which they will fling at intruders. That incendiary material they carry is a natural wonder, with many potential applications. What a waste to carelessly throw it at me whenever I pass by.
  - Flintflame Flyer:
![FLEENTSTONES?!](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/b1/B_Flintflame_Flyer.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Brave worker carrying unstable flintflame and wearing a heavy bell to protect against potential ignition. Theirs would be a high risk life, followed by a short, searing end.
  - Smokerock Sifter:
![egg](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1d/B_Smokerock_Sifter.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Cymbal bearing worker of the Deep Docks. Pans the hauls of smokerock to find traces of more precious minerals. The Haunting has stolen some important part of these bugs, yet still they attempt their former task. Until, that is, they sense my presence...
  - Deep Diver:
![deev](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/e/ef/B_Deep_Diver.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Bell-clad bug responsible for mining the deeper, treacherous depths below their docks. Their heavier bells armour them well against my strikes, but against that oppressive heat... can they help at all?

::: details Hunters March
- The lands of the Skarr Tribe, home to many traps.
- Leader: Last Claw
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Skarrlid:
![https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/ad/B_Skarrlid.png](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/ad/B_Skarrlid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Small burrowing ant, servant to the larger Skarr. These bugs work mainly as finders and foragers for the warriors of their tribe. Combat has not long been their nature.
  - Skarrwing:
![feeff](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/20/B_Skarrwing.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Darting predator that clings fast to roofs and outcrops, often summoned to aid its larger companions. They would make effective hunting companions, though even without the Haunting I suspect their loyalty would always remain to their clan.
  - Skarr Scout:
![ruhyeifbovuegt](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2b/B_Skarr_Scout.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Young ant hunter wielding sickles carved from teeth. Will often call for aid if danger comes close. Despite their youth, they are impressive opponents. It seems likely their tribe were trained for combat from birth.
  - Skarr Stalker:
![ecefvrfv](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/13/B_Skarr_Stalker.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Skilled ant hunter bearing blade and armour fashioned from bone. Fierce, strong and disciplined... yet these qualities do not protect them from the Haunting. Is such a fate inevitable in these lands?
  - Spear Skarr:
![  dedededed](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/6/6e/Spear_Skarr.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Winged ant hunter that strikes from the air with its bone lance. In my youth, I envied all bugs with wings. I even fancied I might grow a pair... I have since learned better. Accept the limitations of one's body... and augment with tools as needed.
  - Skarrgard:
![eicfefvirvri](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/4/44/B_Skarrgard.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Huge ant hunter tasked to protect the stores and passages of its tribe. Theirs is the perfect shell for their duty, a wall of a warrior and an adept fighter. If I hope to claim their treasures, I must bring my best.

:::
::: details Far Fields
- The outer reaches of the Skarr Tribe, unintentionally heated by Deep Docks.
- Leader: Last Claw
- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Savage Beastfly:
![theworstboss /j](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/6/68/B_Savage_Beastfly.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Angered, adult Beastfly with a weighty body and a thickened hardshell mask. Civilisation encroaches from this kingdom's crown, but the lowlands are still ruled by great beasts. Its roar stirs something deep within me, some primal instinct.
  - Caranid:
![thisthingy](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/8/82/B_Caranid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Common winged bug of the lowlands. Generally docile, but will attack if threats come close. Their plump, round shape makes them well-suited for target practice. Difficult to resist testing my aim on them...
  - Vile Caranid:
![thisalttextwontbeusedright?](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2c/B_Vicious_Caranid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Aggressively winged bug of the lowlands. When angered, it rapidly whips its bladed tail as a weapon. Its wings are quite small compared to its bulk. Perhaps it uses the warm air of these fiery lands to help stay airborne. Clever, if so.
  - Hardbone Hopper:
![technically its deepdocks but it also fits here better soooooo](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2e/B_Hardbone_Hopper.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Grazing creature with sharp senses that nimbly retreats from danger. Despite the Haunting of its shell, it has not been overcome with aggression. Its desire to flee remains too strong.
  - Hardbone Elder:
![here ig](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/2/2c/B_Hardbone_Elder.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Tall creature with sharp senses. Defends its herd with powerful legs and a sharp tipped mask. There is surprising strength hidden in their thin, elegant limbs. It would be a pleasure to ride upon it...
  - Tarmite:
![Termate](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/06/B_Tarmite.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Flying bone mite that lives near magma. Roasts its prey by spitting scorching tar. Its sticky spit would no doubt make a useful crafting material if moulded fresh. Unfortunately, I cannot stop to experiment.
  - Mawling:
![shush i know](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/7/70/B_Mawling.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Young, bony bug that can curl its body to form a ball. Their rough, ridged shell grips tight to any surface. Even walls and roofs become pathways for these nimble bugs.
  - Marrowmaw:
![so these are actually found inthe moss , nmed after the marrow, and i put it in far fielsd](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/4/4a/B_Marrowmaw.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Giant roller of the lowlands. Its ridged hide will crush smaller creatures beneath it. Sheer bulk makes for an effective weapon, but requires much sustenance. This creature would have spent most of its time eating. An acceptable life for some.
  - Hoker:
![hoker](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/0d/B_Hoker.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Spine-shooting drifter of the lowlands. Whatever admiration I had for its fleecy down is spoilt by its disturbing mask... and its steely spines.
  - Flintbeetle:
![fleetle](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/1/1a/B_Flintbeetle.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Rarely seen beetle that spends most of its life nestled deep in bone and rock. The flintgems on its shell excrete an explosive powder. Its bright gems could be used to make beautiful, but short-lived jewellery. An amusing idea for a gift... or a trap.
  - Rhinogrund:
![did you meet this?](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/07/B_Rhinogrund.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Long-Horned beast of Pharloom's lowlands. Relies on its horn to both impale and to wrench the ground beneath it, flinging dangerous debris. Certain tools and skills can pierce its defences. I should adjust my strategy as needed.
  - Brushflit:
![dowpeoeodkiedjcfiruhnviru](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/5/51/B_Brushflit.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Tiny, timid creatures that huddle in flocks and flee at the first hint of danger. They call out to their fellows at the smallest sense of threat. A successful hunt here means staying silent and hidden right up until the decisive strike.
  - Fertid:
![eodierjfvoruit](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/7/74/B_Fertid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Skittish scrambler of the Far Fields. Its antennae resemble stalks of grass to aid in camouflage. It has no means to defend itself. Its only hope for survival is to be mistaken for a plant.
  - Flapping Fertid:
![keerceceecfcf](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/a7/B_Flapping_Fertid.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Docile bugs whose wings mimic the grasses of the Far Fields. A common snack for larger predators. When roosting, it would look convincingly plant-like. In flight, its bulbous body quickly ruins the ruse.
  - Fourth Chorus:
![ecowdeweccwe](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/thumb/d/db/B_Fourth_Chorus.png/600px-B_Fourth_Chorus.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Towering iron automaton, driven by rotor and cog. A terrifying achievement of Pharloom, to build a construct so large and yet so nimble.

- Bestiary & Locals:
  - Mite:
![erf](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/0/09/B_Mite.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Verminous pest, common throughout the dark corners of Greymoor. Individually they offer little challenge, but their numbers are surely vast, and most remain hidden.
  - Fluttermite:
![ergry](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/c/c5/B_Fluttermite.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Airborne pest, less common than its grounded siblings. Attacks with sharp fangs if agitated. Similar bugs would gnaw away at unguarded food supplies in my homeland. As a child, I would hunt them, eager to make use of myself and test my skills.
  - Mitemother:
![erfurutviruv](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/a/ae/B_Mitemother.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Aged female mite, grown larger and stronger than most of its kin. Poor of sight but possessing a keen sense of smell, it uses its bulk to charge at foreign scents. Remaining fierce so far into old age is an admirable trait.
  - Dreg Catcher:
![edfrtrttrrt](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/b/bb/B_Dreg_Catcher.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Bug charged to catch dregs of Silk that fall from the Citadel. Will attack with its staff if provoked. These bugs look to have spent every waking moment at their work. Grim, endless labour in service of the unseen Citadel above.

![the adhd bee made this site](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/e/e8/B_Gromling.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Young masked worm that delights in ambushing intruders within its tunnels. A frustrating fiend. They flee beneath the bone whenever I try to strike them down.
  - Grom:
![qwef](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/8/8e/B_Grom.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Burrowing worm that uses its many blunted teeth to dig through even the hardest bone. They ceaselessly churn through rock and bone without ever seeming to rest. Do they have a destination? Or are they compelled to dig forever deeper?
  - Cragglite:
![this](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/f/fc/B_Cragglite.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Infant form of the more formidable Craggler. If left to grow, these young bugs will fight for dominance until only one remains.
  - Craggler:
![this is a boss?](https://cdn.wikimg.net/en/hkwiki/images/6/61/B_Craggler.png)
    - Hornet's notes: Thick-plated scuttler that prefers high places. Holds an extensive supply of searing acid in a layered sack within its shell. The acid rains from its mouth upon any creature it sees as food.
